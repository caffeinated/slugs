Caffeinated Slugs is still in a very early WIP stage.

## Quick Installation
Begin by installing the package through Composer. Add `caffeinated/slugs` to your composer.json file:

```
"caffeinated/slugs": "~1.0@dev"
```

Then run `composer update` to pull the package in.

And that's it! With your coffee in reach, start building out some unique slugs!
